            <h3>For my interview I interviewed a software engineer named Gary Coltrane. Gary Coltrane was a software engineer for IBM and has interned for companies such as Chase and JP Morgan. When I asked him what a typical day at IBM was like he described it as so: </h3>
            <li>In the morning you would have a stand-up meeting and discuss what you would need help with, where you are in certain projects and just get everyone up to date.</li>
            <li>From there you would code for about an hour and a half and then have a meeting with the project manager. In the meeting the project manager would check your code, answer questions that the engineers have, and give advice on which direction to take the project in.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, you would have lunch then code for the remainder of the day.</li>
