            <h3>All of my goals are important to each other. They are steps to the next goal in line. An example of this is my short term to mid-range goal, graduating highschool with a high GPA and a good SAT score will lead to me going to a college with a good computer science program. These will be the foundations to become a successful software engineer</h3>

            <li>Get a high ACT or SAT score in order to get into one of the following colleges: Manhattan College, Stony Brook, University at Buffalo, SUNY New Paltz, City College or Hunter College.</li>
            <li>I would want to attend the schools above as they all have good Computer Science programs for the price </li>
            <li>Research and apply for many scholarships as this will hopefully be my main way of paying for college along with financial aid. </li>
            <li>Apply for and complete internships as it increases your chance to get hired as it shows you have expierence. </li>
